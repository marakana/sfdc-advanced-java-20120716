Polymorphism:
  - Maintain Liskov Substitutability (LSP): client code's expectations
    should be maintained by subclasses.
  - Establish behavioral contracts (business requirements) through tests
  - Only inherit from immutable classes
  
Immutability is a Big Deal!!!!!
  - Allows us to reason more easily about polymorphism
  - Solves almost all of our basic concurrency problems

Testing:
  - With JUnit, favor obnoxiously long method names
  - Only one assertion per test method, keep tests isolated
